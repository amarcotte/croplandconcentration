<h1>Project Concept</h1>
    <a name="story"></a><h2>Story</h2>
    	<p>The United States is an agriculture giant—It is the world's largest exporter of <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/corn/trade.aspx" alt="Article on Corn Trade">corn</a>, <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/wheat/trade.aspx" alt="Article on Wheat Trade">wheat</a>, and <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/soybeans-oil-crops/trade.aspx" alt="Article on Soybean Trade">soybeans</a> by a huge margin. Over the decades, the output of each of these crops has risen and fallen, possibly coinciding with new farming technologies, rising (or falling) global demand, and new uses for the crops.</p>
        <p>For someone who wants to examine the effects of these issues on the agriculture industry, what is a good starting point? Crop production all ties back to cropland, physical places within the US. Therefore, in order to examine US crop production for these three crops in greater detail, I will plot cropland concentrations over the years 1930–2010 via choropleth over a map of all US counties.</p>
        <p>The concentrations for all cropland are shown first to establish a baseline of comparison, since the concentration of all cropland regardless of type stays relatively stable. In other words, it's very likely that "new" cropland will be discovered, only existing cropland being repurposed for different crops.</p>

    <a name="inspiration"></a><h2>Inspiration</h2>
    	<p>Growing up as a child, I would make yearly trips to our family's farm in western Kansas for the wheat harvest. My father, who grew up on the farm, would drive me and my siblings from the east coast across half the country…a two-day trip. During the drive, we'd watch as trees and mountains gave way to endless fields of crops. Seeing the landscape morph into an entirely different world was an experience that stuck with me, although I did not become interested in agriculture in general until much later.</p>

<p>Going into my teens and then my college years, certain things started to click for me. I remember learning in school that the U.S. is the world's largest exporter of wheat, and finally connected that to the large wheat fields my family would harvest. Later on, after learning about the huge demand for corn and soy—the other two major crops grown on our farm—I realized that my family was part of the foundation of a giant industry, at the most essential level!</p>

<p>Fast forward to now: I saw a way to explore my heritage using the things I was learning in my grad school program as tools, so that I could discover more and share it with everyone.</p>
        
    <a name="meaning"></a><h2>Meaning</h2>
    	<p>For the general public, or more importantly, students and young people who are studying agriculture, this interactive map provides context for what they may be learning or already know. People viewing this map will be able to see how crop production numbers actually refer to specific places, and can get truer sense of how agricultural a region is compared to other regions, or compared to itself in different times. The map also raises people's awareness of where they live—at a glance, they can see how close they are to major crop-producing areas.</p>
        
    <a name="uniqueness"></a><h2>Uniqueness</h2>
    	<p>Plotting data on a choropleth map is not unique; even plotting U.S. cropland has been done before. What is unique about this project is it's editorial focus. By mapping cropland concentration instead of total cropland for a particular area, we get a more accurate sense of how agricultural that area is. Obviously, a larger area is going to have more acres overall than a smaller area, but that says nothing about the density. It's often the case that a tiny county in fertile state like Delaware is much more dense with cropland than a very large county in a dryer state like Arizona. Mapping cropland concentration eliminates the bias towards larger land area.</p>
        <p>Also unique is the choice to focus on just a few crops versus every crop grown in the US. This visualization groups <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/ag101/cropmajor.html">the nation's three most-produced crops</a> together on a map (also mapping all cropland to provide context) as a way of expressing that these three crops account for the bulk of all crop production in the United States. Their grouping enables someone to see how US land is "split" among the three big crops.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the visualization makes it easy to change the time context for each crop, creating a new way to spot trends and patterns (rather than a simple line or bar graph).</p>
        
    <a name="analyzation"></a><h2>Discoving an Idea by Analyzing Data</h2>
    <p>When I started my research for this project, I only knew that I wanted to help other people understand the big, wide world of farming a little better. That's it. I was looking to the data to guide me in the right direction for a story. However, looking at all spreadsheets and databases that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had to offer, I was completely overwhelmed at first.

<p>Then my family farm came to the rescue.</p>

<p>On my most recent trip out west, my uncle shared some very interesting documents that he would use to help him run the farm. They included aerial maps of the entire farm that were shaded in sections according to the last crop that was planted there. I absolutely loved this; I could see in an instant how truly large and spread out our farm actually was, and the spatial distribution of the crops planted. In that moment I understood more about the farm than I ever did before, and that helped me decide that I wanted to gain a similar understanding about the entire U.S.</p>

<p>After that, finding the supporting data was simple—I started searching crop production numbers at the highest level possible: county-level data. I imagined (and confirmed) that plotting the county-level data would show clearly where the most productive parts of the US were.</p>
